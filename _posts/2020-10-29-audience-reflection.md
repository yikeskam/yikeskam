We made it! It is almost the end of the semester, and we are finally embarking on what the entire semester has been leading up to– the final project. I am excited to explore and apply everything we have learn this semester. I have been thinking a lot about what to do for the final project. I considered a hypertext fiction among other ideas but ultimately landed on doing a blog. I am most likely going to do a lifestyle blog or a book blog. I picked these because they are things that I am interested in and would enjoy writing about. 

One thing I need to consider is the type of audience that my blog would gear towards. This is one of the most important aspects to think about because it will impact how I will write, what I will write about, the layout and design of the site, etc. I already know some characteristics of my implied audience. I know I will have an informal audience because the content is interest-based, it’s not a research document or anything serious like that. 

One thing I am excited to explore is the design of my sit, particularly the color scheme. The reading explained the importance of color in that it can play a major role in the mood and tone of the site and signaling the implied reader. I am thinking about the impact of using earth tones. I think it would make the user of the site feel calm and grounded while navigating through the content. I also just think earth tones are the prettiest and most aesthetically pleasing. According to “Seven Rules for Website Color Schemes,” color is the first thing that the reader notices about the website. I never thought much of a website’s color scheme much until now. I guess it was just something I overlooked. But lately, after reading the weekly reading, I have been noticing the colors of websites more and how the use of those colors is relaying a certain message about the website and its content. 

Another aspect of sites that is crucial but can be neglected is accessibility. Making sure that a site is usable for everyone, regardless of ability status, is extremely important. Some key steps to take to making a site accessible are the site should be keyboard friendly, the colors for the site should be carefully chosen, text should be resizable, and automatic media, audio, and navigation should not be used. This is not an exhaustive list, but these are great things to think about when thinking about web accessibility. 

I am excited to explore these topics further over the  next week!
