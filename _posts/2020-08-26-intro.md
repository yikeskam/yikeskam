Thanks for viewing my first post!

My name is Kamryn(she/her), and I am an English major from Belton, TX. I love reading, singing, laughing, and hanging out with my friends and family! Some of my favorite movies are You've Got Mail (Meg Ryan is in it, so it's a classic), La La Land, Juno, and Shrek The Third. I also love listening to music. Some of my favorite artists are Lorde, Barbra Streisand, Taylor Swift, Queen, and Wallows, just to name a few.
Lately, I've been obsessed with making homemade matcha. It is delicious, and one of my few attempts to be healthy! I highly recommend. 

I am super excited about this course. I initially took it because I am considering a job in digital writing. The world we live in is basically completely digital, even in the writing world, so I believe I will learn valuable skills. It's funny because, when I saw the title of the course, my first thought was learning how to write for a blog! So, this course is already meeting my expectations. (: 

Bye for now!
