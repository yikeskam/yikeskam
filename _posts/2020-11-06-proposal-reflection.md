We made it! It is almost the end of the semester, and we are finally embarking on what the entire semester has been leading up to– the final project. I am excited to explore and apply everything we have learn this semester. I have been thinking a lot about what to do for the final project. I considered a hypertext fiction among other ideas but ultimately landed on doing a blog. I am most likely going to do a lifestyle blog or a book blog. These are things that I am interested in and would enjoy writing about, so I figured it would be a good idea. 

One thing I need to consider is the type of audience that my blog would gear towards. This is one of the most important aspects to think about because it will impact how I will write, what I will write about, the layout and design of the site, etc. I already know some characteristics of my implied audience. I know I will have an informal audience because the content is interest-based, it’s not a research document or anything serious like that. 

Now that I have had some time to think about it, I have decided to use Tumblr as my blog platform. This is kind of embarrassing, but I used to have a One Direction blog on Tumblr back in middle school, and it was so much fun. I am excited to use Tumblr again but in a more professional (?) way. The thing I am most excited about is finding a theme that I like (aside from writing actual content). There is a plethora of themes out there and finding the one will somewhat of a difficult task, but it will be enjoyable, nonetheless. 

“Keeping It Bookish” is what I have decided to name my blog. I think it has a nice ring to it, and users will know exactly what to expect from my blog upon hearing the name. I will post all kinds of bookish content, such as photos, reviews, recommendations, updates, and my thoughts. I already have an idea for a post that delves into an analysis of modern gothic fiction. I am pretty excited about it. I want to make the kind of book blog that I would want to go to everyday and read. 

This idea was inspired by Ariel Bisset, a book YouTuber and blogger. Ariel, I would say, is a pioneer of the book blogging arena. If you love reading, you need to look her up and watch her videos. I have followed her for at least three years, and I don’t regret it one bit. She has a fantastic literary perspective, and I have learned a lot from her.  

I am currently in the process of finding a theme for my blog. Easy navigation is the main feature I am looking for, but I also want people to look at it and say, “Well, that’s a good-looking blog.” Wish me luck! This may take a while.
