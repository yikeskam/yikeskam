title: "Reflective Post: Markup"
---

To be honest, this week’s topic was a bit challenging for me. I understood the reading just fine. I understood the elements of a document, and how markdown and HTML relate to web documents. When I started the “What is Markup?” Activity, I was doing fine until I had to put the navigation menu code into the default.html file. When trying to place the code into the file, I could not figure out where it was supposed to go. On top of that dilemma, every time I put the navigation menu code into the file and went to look at my site, the site repeated. The first half of the page was how my blog looked before (the Cayman theme), and the second half was the primer theme, except it had the navigation bar. I am still perplexed. I have been googling to try to figure out the issue, but alas, maybe I have found a question that google can’t answer. I am still going to continue to try to figure it out, because I really want to learn how. 

In my ENGL 320 class, we are honing our editing skills by editing Wikipedia articles. The work in that class aligns with what we are doing in this class, which is kinda cool. Wikipedia allows contributors (editors) to edit the page as we see it published, or it can be edited through “source edit.” This is basically using HTML to edit an article, or as Wikipedia calls it, Wikicode. My experience with HTML on Wikipedia has been a lot easier than it has on GitHub, though. Maybe because Wikipedia has a more basic template? I’m not sure. One of my tasks was to add a reference section and reference list to the page using Wikicode. It went pretty smoothly. 

There is still one thing that I struggle with when it comes to editing code on GitHub: where do I place things, like a navigation menu code? I guess what I am struggling with is understanding what the code is telling me. I think HTML hates me. 

Hopefully, by the next reflection post, I will be able to report back that HTML and I have come to an understanding.
