title: Data Visualization

With what little I know about data and its structure, I believe that all of these visualizations are both list and dictionary compound data combined. Then, if you look closer, scalar data and compound data make up the two.

Team Member Cards:

I believe that the goal of this visualization is to give information about different team members that work for a company. This visualization is very effective in its goal. The visualization provides necessary information and does so in a way that is visually appealing and interesting. 

The Demographics of Others:

This visualization is effective at showing the demographics of different groups of people. In fact, I think it is the most effective because all criteria, such as age, race, gender, etc. can all be filtered to get different results.

“Based on a True True Story:”

This visualization is effective at giving information about the reality of movie scenes. Also, it is very clear as to what the data is telling the viewer.
