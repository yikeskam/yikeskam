The activity for this week was to play an interactive game on Twine. This activity provided a great illustration of hypertexts and how they work. The game I chose to play was [Depression Quest](http://www.depressionquest.com/dqfinal.html), an interactive (non) fiction about living with depression.

Overall, I found the game entertaining (for lack of a better word). It was thought-provoking, saddening, and hit kinda close to home. If someone who has never been through depression were to play this game, they would learn so much because the game so accurately depicts the experience of having the illness. I also like that the ending is unclear, and the story never really ends, creating a multifaceted experience that is never the same for the person playing the game.

The game was similar to a traditional game in that it has a storyline, characters, and you play it online. Most games have all of these elements (I think, I am not much of a gamer, so I could be completely off). However, this game has almost no graphics or animation, which are usually the main focus in traditional games. 

Depression Quest was very different from traditional short stories. It had characters and plot like a short story does, however, the plot depended on the decisions that I made throughout the game. Also, the game is worded in a way where you are immersed in the story even more because it is an interactive or role-playing game where you feel like you are in the game experiencing it. I have never played a game like this one, so it was pretty cool!
