Yikes, Kam was made originally because I am in ENGL 460 and making this blog is a requirment. But regardless of the blog's beginnings, I want to use this space not only as a place to post assignments. I also want to practice digital writing by posting content about things that I am interested in. 

To practice embedding images, I'm going to list some things I am interested in paired with an image to illustrate:

Books. Books. Books.

Finding the method to making the perfect matcha latte.

I love beauty, specifically skincare.
