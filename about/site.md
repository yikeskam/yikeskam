Yikes, Kam was made originally because I am in ENGL 460 and making this blog is a requirment. But regardless of the blog's beginnings, I want to use this space not only as a place to post assignments. I also want to practice digital writing by posting content about things that I am interested in. 

Below I have listed some things that I am interested in and would like to explore more throught this blog:


Books. Books. Books.
